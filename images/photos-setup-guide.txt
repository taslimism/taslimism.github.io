# Adding Your Own Photos

To add your own photos to the gallery:

## Option 1: Using External URLs (Current Setup)
1. Create a new `.md` file in `/content/photos/`
2. Use this template:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Photo Title"
date = 2025-01-15
description = "Short description"

[extra]
image = "https://your-image-url.com/image.jpg"
process_image = false
+++

Optional longer description or story about the photo.
```

## Option 2: Using Local Images
1. Place your image in `/static/images/`
2. Create a `.md` file in `/content/photos/`
3. Use this template:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Photo Title"
date = 2025-01-15
description = "Short description"

[extra]
image = "/images/your-photo.jpg"
process_image = false
+++

Optional content here.
```

## Option 3: With Automatic Image Processing
If you have large images and want Zola to automatically resize them:

1. Place your image in `/content/photos/` alongside the `.md` file
2. Use this template:

```markdown
+++
title = "Your Photo Title"
date = 2025-01-15
description = "Short description"

[extra]
image = "your-photo.jpg"
process_image = true
+++

Optional content here.
```

The template will automatically resize images to 400px width for faster loading.

## Tips
- Use images with varying heights for the best masonry effect
- Keep descriptions short for cleaner hover effects
- Images are lazy-loaded for better performance
- The layout is responsive: 4 columns on desktop, 3 on tablet, 2 on mobile, 1 on small phones
