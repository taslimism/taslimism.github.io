# Images Directory

Place your own images here to use them in the photo gallery.

Supported formats:
- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)
- GIF (.gif)

For best results:
- Use images with varying aspect ratios for an interesting masonry layout
- Optimize images before uploading (aim for under 1MB per image)
- Consider using WebP format for better compression

To reference images from this directory in your photo posts, use:
`image = "/images/your-image-name.jpg"`
