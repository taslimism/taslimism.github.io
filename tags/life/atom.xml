        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;i studied electronics and communication engineering in my bachelors because i wanted to keep my options open. during the course i found myself drawn to specific subjects (and chapters) like electromagnetic theory, fourier analysis, communication systems, digital electronics, numerical methods, C programming and data structures and algorithms. these weren&#x27;t just subjects to pass - they made me curious about how things actually work.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;kids, sometimes in life you cannot differentiate between reality and dreams. most don&#x27;t get the opportunity to wake up, all their life. they suffer silently and unknowingly.
it helps to be around people who can ground you in reality because they can see you better than you can ever see yourself. they too had similar dreams. so if you ever find someone like that, just hold on to them tightly, just like a baby would. they will be the one who will make your life beautiful in ways you cannot even fathom.
don&#x27;t tell tales. and always believe you can shed your skin on the hills you have died on, this is the only way to live a richer and fuller life.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
