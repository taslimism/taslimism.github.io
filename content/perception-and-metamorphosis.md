kids, sometimes in life you cannot differentiate between reality and dreams. most don't get the opportunity to wake up, all their life. they suffer silently and unknowingly.
it helps to be around people who can ground you in reality because they can see you better than you can ever see yourself. they too had similar dreams. so if you ever find someone like that, just hold on to them tightly, just like a baby would. they will be the one who will make your life beautiful in ways you cannot even fathom. 
don't tell tales. and always believe you can shed your skin on the hills you have died on, this is the only way to live a richer and fuller life.
