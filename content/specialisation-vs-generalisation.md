i have stopped thinking in terms of generalist or specialist.

<!-- more -->

its slave morality (nietzschean). instead i now think in terms of things i want to do and then go on doing shit i need to get it done. if my goal requires me to
learn coding. i'll learn.
learn marketing. i'll learn.
learn designing. i'll learn.
persuade people. i'll f\*cking do it bro.
its better if i don't have do to it alone. but if nobody is there. i'll do it alone
but this requires true desire of my own. this is master morality (nietzschean).
generalist v/s specialist is the perspective of a person who sees everything as an employment program. think in terms of what you want to achieve and do every fucking possible thing to get there.
