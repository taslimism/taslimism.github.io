when we look at others we are not looking at others. we are viewing them from our lens and if the lens is tainted (which obviously it is) then everything gets such.

similarly when are observing the so called self we are not looking at the self it is too tainted by the observer.

so self observation is not a different phenomenon than observing others. in both of them we are looking at ourselves and not them.

so all in all developing consciousness was a mis step in evolution bruh.
