consuming content is a deeply personal thing.

<!-- more -->

our liking is shaped by our experiences in life. people who have never consumed art which resonated with them, never build taste and never truly enjoy art, it just becomes another form of social signalling.

they can never watch a movie before looking at their imdb ratings, cannot enjoy songs by not so mainstream artists, kabhi aise comedian ko nahi suna jisey sun ke pet se hasi aaye, naa ki smjh kr, appreciate kr hasna pade. kyun bhai? why bro? its like they need permission of an authority to like what they like.

i am not saying that they must stop enjoying such art altogether, it has enough generic elements for everybody to enjoy and relate to. but how can one not have any movie or artist in their arsenal which nobody in their social circle has ever heard of. their consumption feels 'trying to fit in' at best and pretentious at worst to me.
