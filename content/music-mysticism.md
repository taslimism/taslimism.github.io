when i am listening to music, i notice some lyrics create a deep sensation within me.

<!-- more -->

i _actually_ feel something physically. there is no intellectualisation going on. there is no analysis in those moments. i just _feel_ my feelings. i see that this is the part where my narrative is much stronger for me.
if i truly understand 'why' the lyrics make me feel a certain way, it loses its power.
i find, this is one way to get over the said music and begin to appreciate the technical and artisanal aspect of it, but i do all of it simultaneously, but hey that's just me, you people could try figuring out the why and begin to appreciate music for more than 'just' its lyrics.
