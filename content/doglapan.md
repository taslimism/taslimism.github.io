when somebody hits you in the face? what do you do? you take medicine na. but people don't constantly tell you, hey you are in pain, i will fix you. the medicine you took ain't good enough. i know better.

<!-- more -->

they just trust that you will eventually get better. similarly, when something bothers you mentally, or a 'traumatic' event (event which shatters your narrative you have about yourself) happens, what do you do? you cope with it the way you know best na, but then why do they keep saying, hey you need fixing. i know better. how is this fair? is it not doglapan?

some people introspect, some cope, but i believe eventually you come back 'stronger'(i mean softer) if you do both simultaneously. maybe you come back with a new narrative, or you throw away everything, and just start being. maybe buddha just started being, but we --the non-enlighted beings-- need softer narratives - the lightly held ones.

the thing is if there was no narrative, no event is good/bad, it just is.
