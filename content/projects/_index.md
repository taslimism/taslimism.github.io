Here you'll find examples of my work across different technologies, from **web applications**, **command-line tools** to **chrome-extension**. Each project demonstrates problem-solving skills and technical expertise gained through real-world development challenges.

Feel free to explore the projects below, check out the live demos, and dive into the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/taslimism). I'm always open to feedback and collaboration opportunities!
