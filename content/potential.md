what is potential? is it not your mind telling you, you ought to be doing better things than what you are currently doing?

<!-- more -->

is it not conflict between your mind and soul? and what is conflict, if not something which snatches your current moment and you feel all the 'shoulds' you ought to be doing.

the thing is if you are in tune with your genuine desires, you will reach your so called 'potential'. better frame than 'potential' is to genuinely introspect your true desires and let the doing flow through you.

if you think in terms of potential you will be trapped in vicious trap of never reaching it cause it is not something concrete which you could achieve. you would always be chasing something and i think chasing is a terrible way to live life.
