when we observe ourselves, there comes a realisation that there is no single observer. the observer is sometimes observed and sometimes becomes what we call 'self'.

then who is the real self here? is it all just recursive? what is the point of observation then? why do we get so rigid when there is no self at all? (see there is some self which is getting frustrated here, urghhh) (and i can observe it in real time) (haha, recursion). the thing is, it is all just turtles all the way down. like we just need to dance with all this. the self is infact very very fluid. but the question still remains if the self is fluid, how do we pursue goals? how do we form and maintain relationships? if one sees that everything is just a narrative, who will commit to the bit? is it not just another trick of ego saying look 'I am the guy who can see all narratives' and then get attached to it.
